This project is an ongoing attempt to improve the operation of my Hot Tub and add more features along the way. I have a decent controller running the hot tub and I want to add remote monitoring and control so I can check on the hot tub when I am away. I plan to use a Raspberry Pi as an an add-on device to monitor temperature, current draw for the heater and pump. The existing micro-controller that runs the Hot Tub can accept commands from a serial port to adjust temperature set points, filtration cycles, time of day and pump and light controls.
If I find the RaspberryPi is stable and reliable, I may hook up its GPIOs to control the hot tub directly.
